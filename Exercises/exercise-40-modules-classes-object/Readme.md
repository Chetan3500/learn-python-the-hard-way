# Module, classes and object

The only special operation on a module is attribute access: "m.name", where *m* is a module and *name* accesses a name defined in *m*â€™s symbol table.

A class is a way to take a grouping of functions and data and place them inside a container so you can access them with the . (dot) operator.

In this just overview of class and next exerices learn more.
